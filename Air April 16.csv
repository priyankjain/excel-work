If you choose one of them, remember to pick up AirForce's 11mm-to-Weaver adapter listed in the accessories link.  The AirForce TalonP PCP pistol is heavier than most air pistols and cannot be comfortably held the way most pistols are held and still result in reliable, repeatable accuracy. A comfortable hold is with one hand on the pistol grip and the other holding the top of the scope. If you assume a sitting position, you can hold the grip with one hand and rest the gun's forearm on your off hand's forearm. These two positions will draw the pistol much closer to your eye, and you can mount a rifle scope on the TalonP air pistol.

325;PY-135;0;1;1;0;1;AirForce Talon SS PCP Air Rifle, Spin-Loc Tank;AirForce;9;;;"<strong><font color=red>Equipped with the new Sound-Loc suppressor!</font></strong>  Power! Up to 1000 fps (in .177). Accuracy! 1&quot; at 50 yards. NO recoil! Built in the USA, the Talon SS pre-charged pneumatic air rifle is for serious shooting. Field target, hunting, punching paper targets, shooting spinners and plinking are all perfect for the Talon SS...because it does everything so well! The easy-to-use power-adjust wheel takes your rifle from 400 fps to 1000 fps. You decide how much power you want and when you want it. If you're shooting field target...dial it down. Hunting...dial it up.  From its Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist) to its removable air tank, the Talon SS is the standard for state-of-the-art manufacturing of pre-charged pneumatics. Made of space-age polymers and aircraft-grade aluminum, the AirForce Talon SS is lightweight and equipped with a durable finish.  The removable 490cc air tank (DOT-certified) can be filled with a hand pump, scuba tank or electric compressor to 3000 psi (206 bar) for lots of shots without a refill. The tank does double-duty as the butt of the gun, contributing to its light weight and convenience. The tank has a pressure-release valve for additional safety.  Thanks to the new Spin-Loc tank and collar, you don't have to remove the gun's air reservoir to fill it. Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get all of them! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.  The Talon SS is the same basic rifle as the Talon, but an integral suppressor and a 12&quot; barrel are standard. The shorter barrel makes it slightly lighter than the Talon, and the integral suppressor seriously reduces the report.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air. The type of adapter depends on how you plan to fill your gun. A scuba tank will require a different adapter than a hand pump or carbon fiber tank.

Hunting...dial it up.  From its Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist) to its removable air tank, the Talon SS is the standard for state-of-the-art manufacturing of pre-charged pneumatics. Made of space-age polymers and aircraft-grade aluminum, the AirForce Talon SS is lightweight and equipped with a durable finish.   The removable 490cc air tank (DOT-certified) can be filled with a hand pump, scuba tank or electric compressor to 3000 psi (206 bar) for lots of shots without a refill. The tank does double-duty as the butt of the gun, contributing to its light weight and convenience. The tank has a pressure-release valve for additional safety.  Thanks to the new Spin-Loc tank and collar, you don't have to remove the gun's air reservoir to fill it. Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get all of them! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.  The Talon SS is the same basic rifle as the Talon, but an integral suppressor and a 12&quot; barrel are standard. The shorter barrel makes it slightly lighter than the Talon, and the integral suppressor seriously reduces the report.  There are lots of ways to configure this gun, including rail-mounted accessories (coin-slot screws for each changeout). You can choose the laser, flashlight, night vision equipment, extra tanks, quick-detach fiber-optic sights and attachments for the type of refilling unit you plan to use. If you replace the barrel with a longer one, the gun will not be silenced.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air. The type of adapter depends on how you plan to fill your gun. A scuba tank will require a different adapter than a hand pump or carbon fiber tank. If you use a hand pump, the type of adapter you need depends on the brand of hand pump you use.</font>";pyr/AF-TalonSS-W-Spin-Loc-Tank-RED_AFU20232R.jpg;pyr/AF-TalonSS-W-Spin-Loc-Tank-RED_AFU20232R.jpg;pyr/AF-TalonSS-W-Spin-Loc-Tank-RED_AFU20232R.jpg;4.31;1.96;0.25;665;100;AFU202325R;474.3;520.83;26.04;35.55;2;558.38;670.05;pyrsm/AF-TalonSS-W-Spin-Loc-Tank-RED_AFU20232R_sm.jpg;AIR RIFLES;12;;;PY-2244-4912;;PY-2541;AIRSOFT GUNS

395;PY-3071;0;1;1;0;1;AirForce Talon SS, Red Precharged Pneumatic Rifle;AirForce;9;;;"For those of you who want the look, feel and power of a black rifle...but with color! Choose the Talon SS with a red anodized frame.  Power! Up to 1000 fps (in .177). Accuracy! 1&quot; at 50 yards. NO recoil! Built in the USA, the Talon SS pre-charged pneumatic air rifle is for serious shooting. Field target, hunting, punching paper targets, shooting spinners and plinking are all perfect for the Talon SS...because it does everything so well! The easy-to-use power-adjust wheel takes your rifle from 400 fps to 1000 fps. You decide how much power you want and when you want it. If you're shooting field target...dial it down. Hunting...dial it up.  From its Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist) to its removable air tank, the Talon SS is the standard for state-of-the-art manufacturing of pre-charged pneumatics. Made of space-age polymers and aircraft-grade aluminum, the AirForce Talon SS is lightweight and equipped with a durable finish.   The removable 490cc air tank (DOT-certified) can be filled with a hand pump, scuba tank or electric compressor to 3000 psi (206 bar) for lots of shots without a refill. The tank does double-duty as the butt of the gun, contributing to its light weight and convenience. The tank has a pressure-release valve for additional safety.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get all of them! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.  The Talon SS is the same basic rifle as the Talon, but an integral suppressor and a 12&quot; barrel are standard. The shorter barrel makes it slightly lighter than the Talon, and the integral suppressor seriously reduces the report.  There are lots of ways to configure this gun, including rail-mounted accessories (coin-slot screws for each changeout).

The unusual overlever cocking mechanism compresses the powerful mainspring, and the hammer is actually the catch for it. Highly adjustable two-stage trigger, which has a serrated surface for more control, will help you extract maximum accuracy from the P1. In fact, the adjustable trigger is so crisp, you'll wish it was on your firearms.  The dovetail grooves are extra wide, and our accessory list has several 11mm to 14mm mounts that are known to fit.  Unlike many modern air pistols, the P1 isn't made of molded synthetics. It's a solid metal gun with finely checkered walnut grips. And, it's ambidextrous. The 11mm dovetails make it easy to mount a pistol scope or a red dot sight.  The P1 has two power levels. The different power levels are created by cocking the gun to different lock points. See the detail shots to see how to cock the gun for high power and low power.  The distance you shoot, the weight of the pellet and the type of target will let you determine which power level is best.

549;PY-556;0;1;1;0;1;Beeman P3;Beeman;16;;;"Solid construction, accurate, light trigger-pull, easy to cock, fun to shoot! That's just about everything you could ever want in an air pistol. The Beeman P3 is a single-stroke pneumatic, which means it requires just one cocking stroke of the overlever. Because it doesn't have a mainspring, the P3 can also be dry-fired. If you want to increase your accuracy and trigger control, dry-firing can help you do that.Unlike many production pistols, the P3 is made of quality materials. Manufactured by the legendary Weihrauch factory in Germany, this air pistol has a rifled steel barrel. In fact, all critical mechanisms are made of ordnance steel, while the exterior shell is made of tough, durable polymers.Whether you shoot right-handed, left-handed, single-handed or two-handed, the Beeman P3 can accommodate you! The ambidextrous design and the functionality of the cocking mechanism are convenient no matter what style of shooting you enjoy.Accuracy is 0.20&quot; center-to-center. You won't find too many pistols in this price range that can brag about that kind of accuracy! The P3 is perfect for 10-meter target shooting, but you'll end up doing a lot more with the gun. Plinking, shooting spinners, and popping tin cans are loads of fun, and the P3 is up to the challenge!";pyr/Beeman-P3-BN-2360-air-pistol.jpg;pyr/Beeman-P3-BN-2360-air-pistol.jpg;pyr/Beeman-P3-BN-2360-air-pistol.jpg;1.34;0.61;0.177;410;0;BN-2360;179.01;196.57;9.83;13.42;2;211.99;254.38;pyrsm/Beeman-P3-BN-2360-air-pistol_sm.jpg;AIR PISTOLS;11;;;PY-556;;PY-3049;AIRSOFT GUNS

It's great for metallic silhouettes, plinking, shooting spinners and paper targets, and accurate enough to do some serious hunting. If you're hunting game and eliminating pests, .20 or .22 caliber should be your choice.  The quality of the polishing and bluing on the steel action, barrel and underlever exceeds what you'd normally find on comparably priced firearms. The blue laminated stock has a raised RH cheekpiece on the Monte Carlo buttstock. The stock is capped with a soft rubber recoil pad to give you ultimate control.

The Beeman Devastator pellet's patented design has a hollow head and a projecting point coming out of it. Around the edge of the hollowpoint are nicks.  On impact, these nicks create an extreme mushrooming effect that forces the point to project even further. Unique but also amazingly effective! Having the qualities of both a hollowpoint and a pointed pellet, this lead projectile will prove highly effective for hunters and pest eliminators. The mushrooming hollowpoint is the first hit, but the extra penetration of the point is like a second hit on the same quarry.  The world's only partitioned hollowpoint pellet!;pyr/Beeman-Devastator-177cal_BN-52177_pellet_lg.jpg;pyr/Beeman-Devastator-177cal_BN-52177_pellet_lg.jpg;pyr/Beeman-Devastator-177cal_BN-52177_pellet_lg.jpg;0.32;0.15;0.177;;100;BN-52177;6.43;7.06;0.35;0.48;2;9.54;11.45;pyrsm/Beeman-Devastator-177cal_BN-52177_sm.jpg;AMMO;20;;;PY-P-916;;PY-3333;AIRSOFT GUNS

Connect the Foster fitting on the end of the hose to the air reservoir on the rifle.   To exhaust air or CO2 from the rifle, you need to purchase the degasser tool.</font>  Get into precharged guns at an unheard-of price and also get the accuracy of an expensive European rifle!  Benjamin has bridged the gap and taken the pain out of PCP guns. Not only is this as low a price as you'll ever find on a PCP/hand pump combo, but it's so easy to pump up that a wispy teenager could do it!  If you prefer to use a scuba tank instead of the hand pump, you'll need a scuba tank adapter with hose and a female quick-disconnect with male threads. The last item already comes with this kit. The adapter fits tanks with a K valve. The air reservoir has a male Foster fitting.   The Discovery has raised the bar for PCP guns because it uses only 2000 psi of air. While the European companies race toward higher and higher air pressures, Benjamin is going the opposite direction and making it easier than ever to use a hand pump. If you want to use a scuba tank or carbon fiber tank, you can do that, too, and get the benefit of many more fills than you would from a gun that operates with 3000 psi.

Air guns don't require as much cleaning as firearms, but sometimes you have to clean the barrel due to preservative grease used by the manufacturer or if you use pellets that foul the bore with copper or lead. Then, you need to use solvents/cleaners that are aggressive enough to remove the debris/grease but not so harsh that they'll damage the bore. Same goes for brushes.

The Crosman 1377C is a powerful multi-pump pneumatic that's been enjoyed by millions of shooters for decades.  One of the reasons it's so popular is that it delivers a real wallop, spitting pellets out the muzzle at 600 fps (with 10 pumps). This pistol is suitable for plinking, popping paper targets, hitting spinners and killing tin cans.  This pistol comes with a blade front sight and a fully adjustable rear. You can mount a pistol scope or a red dot on it, but you'll need the 459MT intermount. The plastic grip and pump handle are checkered to give you a firm grip. There's even a thumbrest on the grip.  With traditional Crosman reliability built into this pistol, you'll be enjoying it for many years to come and passing it along to your children and grandchildren.;pyr/Crosman-Pneumatic-1377-Pump_CR1377C_pistol_lg.jpg;pyr/Crosman-Pneumatic-1377-Pump_CR1377C_pistol_lg.jpg;pyr/Crosman-Pneumatic-1377-Pump_CR1377C_pistol_lg.jpg;1.13;0.51;0.177;600;100;CR1377C;47.69;52.37;2.62;3.57;2;57.94;69.53;pyrsm/Crosman-Pneumatic-1377-Pump_CR1377C_pistol_sm.jpg;AIR PISTOLS;11;;;PY-198;;PY-2970-5758;AIR RIFLES

1465;PY-1734;0;1;1;0;1;IMI Jericho 941F CO2 Pistol, Semi-Auto;Cybergun;47;;;The Jericho 941 was designed by IMI (Israel Military Industries) and has been on the market since 1990. At first it used .41 caliber munitions, but this caliber did not find acceptance in the marketplace. The Jericho was then offered in 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45ACP.  The Cybergun replica is an airsoft CO2 model with locked breech. The advantage of this technology is that the gas serves only to propel the pellet, making possible a velocity at the mouth of the barrel of 100 m/s (1 joule) with a 0.20-gram BBs. This power is very well directed by a BAX trajectory correction system. The release is smooth and gradual. Taking aim is assisted by the two white points located on the backsight. The magazine has a 15-rd capacity and accommodates the CO2 cartridge. One cartridge lets you fire more than 200 airsoft BBs. This is exceptional performance for a gas gun.;pyr/IMI_CG150300.jpg;pyr/IMI_CG150300.jpg;pyr/IMI_CG150300.jpg;1.86;0.85;0.24;425;100;CG150300;23.87;26.21;1.31;1.79;2;30;36;pyrsm/IMI_CG150300_sm.jpg;AIRSOFT GUNS;17;;;PY-1734;;PY-3381-6494;AIR RIFLES
1466;PY-1735;0;1;1;0;1;SIG Sauer GSR CO2 w/Metal Slide Pistol;Cybergun;47;;;The American subsidiary of SIG SAUER, SIG Arms, took charge of the development of the GSR. In 2003, the demand for .45 ACP hand guns was such that many manufacturers were commercializing replicas of the Colt 1911.<br /><br />  The replica designed by Cybergun is a CO2 'Gas Gun' with locked breech that generates a power of 1 joule. The breech is made entirely of metal and the markings have been engraved by laser, all of which gives a very realistic effect.<br /><br />  The magazine is of the 'Slim' type, meaning that it is no bigger than the hand grip. It has a 15 pellet capacity. The very first CO2 replicas had a very long magazine, which detracted from the realism of the Soft Air. The technical team at Cybergun succeeded in reducing the size of the magazine so that it remains within the proportions of the genuine magazine.<br /><br />  The presence of a Picatinny type rail below the barrel allows you to customize your replica with a flashlight or laser spotter.;pyr/SIG_CG280302.jpg;pyr/SIG_CG280302.jpg;pyr/SIG_CG280302.jpg;1.25;0.57;0.24;425;100;CG280302;42.32;46.47;2.32;3.17;2;51.64;61.97;pyrsm/SIG_CG280302_sm.jpg;AIRSOFT GUNS;17;;;PY-1735;;PY-3381;AIR RIFLES

In the army, he designed a device to count the number of shots fired by a tank as well as other useful tactical devices for tanks. After surviving fierce battles against the Nazi's in 1941 as a tank commander, he found himself in hospital recovering from serious wounds and battle fatigue. Here at the hospital he began to conceive ideas for a new machine gun which could provide high volume, light weight firepower for soldiers in mechanized infantry. While on temporary medical duty, stationed at Matai, he took advantage of the workshop facilities to prototype his weapon. In 1944 his first prototype was adopted for further development and finally in 1949 the soviet army adopted the Automatic Kalashnikov design of 1947 as their standard rifle. As of 1990, more than 70 million Kalashnikov automatic rifles of various designs had been produced. M.T. Kalashnikov was a self taught inventor.

No technology, no special skills, no mess. ALWAYS wear safety glasses and remove all pets from the area as the targets will shatter in all directions.  DIRECTIONS:  Place empty mold in freezer Fill cavities with water (soda bottle works well) For 1/4&quot; thickness, fill to witness mark found at apex of each target For 3/8&quot; thickness, fill to the top of the cavity To remove targets from mold, remove mold from freezer & let rest on counter for 3-4 minutes at room temp To unmold, hold mold upside down over a towel and gently twist at opposite corners Store unmolded targets in freezer til you're ready to shoot   If you want to enhance your targets, add some food coloring. That also makes them easier to see. Get more than one mold and stack filled molds in your freezer. Fill and leave them in the freezer until you're ready to use them. That way, you'll always have some available whenever the mood strikes you to shoot.  In warmer weather, your ice targets may melt faster than you like. Inhibit fast melting by making pykrete, which is a mixture of 14% sawdust and 86% water (by weight...frozen).

For many decades, Feinwerkbau has been a top-tier manufacturer for champion shooters. This magnificent air rifle is not just ergonomic, but it has many ways that you can fine-tune the stock to customize it to your shooting needs. But even if you have a gun that's made just for you, it won't make any difference if it doesn't deliver pinpoint accuracy.  When it comes to groups, yours will be so tight that it'll look like you shot just one pellet with each pull of the trigger. The FWB 700 delivers a 0.04&quot; group (center-to-center).

The dry-fire capability lets you safely and repeatedly fire the gun to hone your shooting skills...especially useful for competitors.  The FWB 700 is infinitely adjustable.

You can adjust just about every part of the trigger, including pull-off point, initial travel, finger length, lateral position and trigger slack weight. All adjustments can be made quickly and easily without any tools and can even be made in the middle of a match.  You will never regret buying an FWB 700 air rifle.

2558;PY-1061;0;1;1;0;1;HFC M190 Combo Metal Semi Auto Pistol Rail Ver.;HFC;87;;;An exact replica in terms of design and function of the Marui M9, this M92 from HFC is a bargain. HFC improved the Marui design with an enlarged and ported gas valve, thereby delivering 20fps more than the Marui Tactical Master / M9. High quality finishing with nickel plated barrel and rubberized grips make this an extremely attractive pistol. Internal mechanism exactly the same as Tokyo Marui's which means that upgrade potential is identical and can use Marui parts. This pistol can even use Marui's standard M9 magazines. Power right out of the box is impressive using TOP GAS / GREEN GAS at 310fps Strong power and recoil. Excellent value for money given the feel and performance!  The HFC M190 is completely metal and only weighs a few ounces less than the real M92. The only visible plastic part on the outside of the gun is the grip. Metal parts included: slide, barrel, magazine, frame, recoil spring guide, hammer, safety, slide stop, rear sight, trigger, magazine catch. It comes with a built on rail for mounting accessories.

Want the suppressor look and feel for your Drozd BB gun without the expense, hassle and government oversight? Our .22LR fake suppressor is as close to a real suppressor as you can get without paying the tax stamp.  It's CNC-machined from a solid aluminum rod, given a durable liquid ceramic finish and professionally laser-engraved. Everything is identical to the real ATF-registered suppressors!   Since its a fake suppressor, the gun's report (loudness) is NOT reduced. Many shooters prefer the weight and balance improvement with the added suppressor. In fact, it'll work on any airgun that has a 1/2&quot;x28 TPI threaded barrel.  To ensure exact thread alignment, the threaded adapters are CNC-machined to precision tolerances from a solid steel rod in one lathe operation. They are hot-salt blued to match the gun. The included steel thread protector covers the threads on your barrel when no accessory is mounted. Easy installation in place of the existing barrel nut. No tools or modifications are required.";pyr/Drozd_Suppressor_1972.jpg;pyr/Drozd_Suppressor_1972.jpg;pyr/Drozd_Suppressor_1972.jpg;0.45;0.2;;;100;IZH-SUPFS22;38.21;41.96;2.1;2.86;2;46.82;56.19;pyrsm/Drozd_Suppressor_1972_sm.jpg;SHOOTING NEEDS AND ACCESSORIES;42;;;PY-A-1972;;PY-A-4518;MAGAZINES, CLIPS & RELOADERS

Large High Capacity Wind-up Airsoft Magazine.High Capacity magazines have a loading door on the top. Simply pour in BBs until the compartment is full. On most magazines you should put at least 100 BBs in the magazine before you initially start to wind it or it will not be able to feed correctly. To wind the magazine turn the wheel on the bottom of the magazine. As you wind the magazine it will make a ticking noise. You will notice that BBs will feed up into the top of the magazine and are visible at the top. Keep winding until the ticking changes to a louder clicking noise which means the magazine is fully wound. Sometimes it is better to wind the magazine after you put it in the gun. If the BB release is bumped while you are putting the magazine into the gun the BBs can spray out and you will have to start all over again.;pyr/LEMAG-M87L.jpg;pyr/LEMAG-M87L.jpg;pyr/LEMAG-M87L.jpg;0.95;0.43;;;100;LEMAG-M87L;6.43;7.06;0.35;0.48;2;9.54;11.45;pyrsm/LEMAG-M87Ls.jpg;AIRSOFT MAGAZINES/CLIPS;18;;;PY-A-957;;PY-A-4492;TARGETS, PELLET AND BB TRAPS, RANGES
