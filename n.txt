It gives the illusion that the barrel is longer than 9.5 inches. It isn't! The barrel is the rifled portion.</font></strong>  The Air Arms Pro-Sport has earned a faithful following among field target shooters because it's remarkably accurate and easy to shoot.  However, you don't have to shoot field target to appreciate this gun. In fact, you might want to get the .22 for hunting rats, mice, rabbits and squirrels. It's super-quiet because it has a barrel shroud that helps deaden the sound.  The Monte Carlo stock and raised cheekpiece are just a couple of the gun's ergonomic features. Air Arms has increased the amount of area that is checkered on the grip and forearm. If you've ever had sweaty palms while hunting or during a match, you'll appreciate the extra gripping power!  The Pro-Sport has a 12-groove Lothar Walther barrel and comes to you in a tuned state. That means you won't have to spend hours or days fiddling with the gun to make it shoot perfectly.  The weight given in the specifications section at left says 9.03 lbs., but that's for the walnut stock.

PY-657	Air Arms S410 TDR Classic	Air Arms	Air Arms' Take Down Rifle is a great idea for airgunners who travel with their guns.

Like all quality rifles, the TDR has a 12-groove Lothar Walther barrel, a 2-stage adjustable trigger and walnut stock with an adjustable buttstock, adjusting from 37&quot; to 41.75&quot;.  This gun isn't just for looks. It's a 10-shot repeater, with space in the rear stock to hold more clips that you can pre-load so you're always ready for more shots. (Gun comes with 1 clip; additional clips available) The air pressure gauge (manometer) always tells you how much air is left in the reservoir. If you want to add a bipod, there's a rail under the forearm just for that purpose.  <font color=red>There are no sights on this gun, so remember to buy a scope & rings!</font>		12 ft-lbs.
