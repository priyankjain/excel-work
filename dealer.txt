Power right out of the box is impressive using TOP GAS / GREEN GAS at 310fps Strong power and recoil. Excellent value for money given the feel and performance!  The HFC M190 is completely metal and only weighs a few ounces less than the real M92. The only visible plastic part on the outside of the gun is the grip. Metal parts included: slide, barrel, magazine, frame, recoil spring guide, hammer, safety, slide stop, rear sight, trigger, magazine catch. It comes with a built on rail for mounting accessories.

PY-1648	HFC SD92/M190 Metal Gas Pistol without rail	TSD	An exact replica in terms of design and function of the Marui M9, this M92 from HFC is a bargain.

PY-1734	IMI Jericho 941F CO2 Pistol, Semi-Auto	Cybergun	The Jericho 941 was designed by IMI (Israel Military Industries) and has been on the market since 1990. At first it used .41 caliber munitions, but this caliber did not find acceptance in the marketplace. The Jericho was then offered in 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45ACP.  The Cybergun replica is an airsoft CO2 model with locked breech. The advantage of this technology is that the gas serves only to propel the pellet, making possible a velocity at the mouth of the barrel of 100 m/s (1 joule) with a 0.20-gram BBs. This power is very well directed by a BAX trajectory correction system. The release is smooth and gradual. Taking aim is assisted by the two white points located on the backsight. The magazine has a 15-rd capacity and accommodates the CO2 cartridge. One cartridge lets you fire more than 200 airsoft BBs. This is exceptional performance for a gas gun.		Fixed sights. Rear sight has 2 white dots for faster target acquisition.	http://www.pyramydair.com/images/IMI_CG150300.jpg	1.86	0.24	425.00			69.95	39.95		100	CG150300	23.87	http://www.pyramydair.com/images/IMI_CG150300_sm.jpg	AIRSOFT GUNS	029858503006	false
PY-1735	SIG Sauer GSR CO2 w/Metal Slide Pistol	Cybergun	The American subsidiary of SIG SAUER, SIG Arms, took charge of the development of the GSR. In 2003, the demand for .45 ACP hand guns was such that many manufacturers were commercializing replicas of the Colt 1911.<br /><br />  The replica designed by Cybergun is a CO2 'Gas Gun' with locked breech that generates a power of 1 joule. The breech is made entirely of metal and the markings have been engraved by laser, all of which gives a very realistic effect.<br /><br />  The magazine is of the 'Slim' type, meaning that it is no bigger than the hand grip. It has a 15 pellet capacity. The very first CO2 replicas had a very long magazine, which detracted from the realism of the Soft Air. The technical team at Cybergun succeeded in reducing the size of the magazine so that it remains within the proportions of the genuine magazine.<br /><br />  The presence of a Picatinny type rail below the barrel allows you to customize your replica with a flashlight or laser spotter.		The Picatinny rail under the barrel allows you to install a laser spotter or a tactical flashlight.	http://www.pyramydair.com/images/SIG_CG280302.jpg	1.25	0.24	425.00			99.95	49.99		100	CG280302	42.32	http://www.pyramydair.com/images/SIG_CG280302_sm.jpg	AIRSOFT GUNS	029858803021	false

PY-1771	Colt Delta Elite Airsoft Spring Pistol	Cybergun	The Colt Delta Elite is a great second chance gun. It is part of the HPA Series, Heavy Powerful Accurate Series. This is a realistic replica.   The Colt Delta Elite uses a Hop-Up system. The &quot;Hop-Up&quot; system creates friction on the BB as it is shot through the barrel. This puts a spin on the BB that helps it to fight gravity, wind resistance, and air friction allowing it to be shot farther.  This is a Spring Airsoft Pistol, which means it's powered by a spring and must be cocked for each shot. It's fast, clean, inexpensive and easily maintained; it requires no gas or batteries to operate. If you're looking for a fun, reliable Airsoft Pistol that'll look great and perform even better, you've come to the right place.

PY-1918	Kalashnikov AK47  Premium AEG Blowback	Cybergun	M.T. Kalashnikov entered the Red Army in Kiev 1938 where he attended tank mechanics school. In the army, he designed a device to count the number of shots fired by a tank as well as other useful tactical devices for tanks. After surviving fierce battles against the Nazi's in 1941 as a tank commander, he found himself in hospital recovering from serious wounds and battle fatigue. Here at the hospital he began to conceive ideas for a new machine gun which could provide high volume, light weight firepower for soldiers in mechanized infantry. While on temporary medical duty, stationed at Matai, he took advantage of the workshop facilities to prototype his weapon. In 1944 his first prototype was adopted for further development and finally in 1949 the soviet army adopted the Automatic Kalashnikov design of 1947 as their standard rifle. As of 1990, more than 70 million Kalashnikov automatic rifles of various designs had been produced. M.T. Kalashnikov was a self taught inventor.

PY-2197	 KWA M9 PTP Metal Gas Pistol	KWA	The M9 PTP was developed exclusively as a durable professional training weapon.  What sets the M9 PTP apart from the competition is the new KWA internal gas delivery system.

The frame and slide of the M9 PTP is constructed from high quality alloy steel and is made to a 1:1 ratio of the real firearm it replicates.  Weights are strategically distributed during production process to closely match the weight and balance of a real firearm. Functional features such as the slide catch and hammer decock safety are faithfully replicated and adds to the realism. Beveled magazine well aids in quick and accurate reload. Even the M9 PTP magazine has been completely redesigned to compliment the new gas system.  Instead of metal stamping, the new magazine is milled from a solid piece of steel bar stock.

The stock and forearm are made of a durable synthetic that takes lots of use and still looks good. An economical rifle, the Pumpmaster takes 3 to 10 pumps to send BBs up to 625 fps and pellets up to 600 fps. The checkering on the grip and the indentations on the pump handle make it that much easier to get a grip and stay on target.  Ideal for plinking and target shooting. (Never shoot BBs at metal objects!) It's so light that you can shoot all day! Suitable for younger shooters (with adult supervision) and smaller adults.  Pellets are loaded into a 5-shot clip, while BBs have an 18-shot magazine, which is fed from the 200-shot reservoir. It comes with a fixed front sight, but you can get even more accuracy by mounting a scope or red dot on the 11mm dovetail.		Versatile multi-pump pneumatic shoots BBs or pellets.	http://www.pyramydair.com/images/Crosman-Pumpmaster-760B_CR760B_lg.jpg	2.49	0.177	625.00			50.00	34.99		100	CR760B	28.69	http://www.pyramydair.com/images/Crosman-Pumpmaster-760B_CR760B_sm.jpg	AIR RIFLES	028478076013	false

PY-463-1295	Sumatra 2500 Carbine	Eun Jin	Devastating, authoritative knockdown power! The Sumatra 2500 is an easy-to-cock, lever-action repeater. This precharged pneumatic (PCP) has two built-in chambers (290cc total) that hold high-pressure air (3,000 psi) from a scuba tank, hand pump or compressor.  It has a two-stage adjustable trigger. The sights are pretty unique, in that both the front and rear are adjustable. The front post can be adjusted for elevation by turning a small wheel under the post. The rear is a two-hole aperture that flips from a small to large hole and is adjustable for windage.  Accuracy is the name of the game when it comes to shooting, and the Sumatra 2500 excels in that area: 3/8&quot; ctc at 30 yds. with Eun Jin pellets. To get the most from this airgun, you'll want to mount a scope on the 11mm dovetails. The finely rifled (and 10x1mm threaded) steel barrel (1:18 RH twist) is fed by a 6-shot cylinder that makes for quick follow-up shots. The cylinder makes it easy to use longer pellets and even mix-and-match different pellet lengths and types.  The adjustable power wheel has 13 settings, making this one of the most versatile powerhouses on the market! You'll get about 11 shots on high power and 18 on medium.  Includes probe with 1/8&quot; BSPP male threads and 2 rotary clips. A hard Plano rifle case (PL1502-01) is strongly suggested!		A hunter's dream! Includes two 6-shot cylinders & a fill probe.

PY-574	Beeman HW97K air rifle	Beeman	The HW97K is related to one of the first - and finest - underlever field target rifles ever made. Coming from the famed plant in Germany, it's proving to be just as accurate. Even if you're not a field target enthusiast, you'll enjoy shooting this rifle! It's great for metallic silhouettes, plinking, shooting spinners and paper targets, and accurate enough to do some serious hunting. If you're hunting game and eliminating pests, .20 or .22 caliber should be your choice.  The quality of the polishing and bluing on the steel action, barrel and underlever exceeds what you'd normally find on comparably priced firearms. The Monte Carlo stock has a raised cheekpiece, and the beech stock has hand-cut checkering on the pistol grip. The stock is capped with a soft rubber recoil pad to give you ultimate control.  Includes 1&quot; scope rings, medium profile, vertical scope stop in one ring, 2 screws per base & 4 screws per ring cap.			http://www.pyramydair.com/images/Beeman-HW97K_BN-1097A_rifle_lg.jpg	3.70	0.22	750.00	model		769.95	629.95				0.00	http://www.pyramydair.com/images/Beeman-HW97K_BN-1097A_rifle_sm.jpg	AIR RIFLES		false

Whether you plan to shoot again the next day or not again for another 2 years, always put one pump into the gun when you're done shooting!  <Font color=red>This air rifle has no scope rail or dovetail. An Air Venturi Intermount is attached to the breech, a Weaver/Picatinny rail is attached to the intermount and scope rings are mounted on the rail.</font>  Combo includes Benjamin 392 rifle with an UNmounted Leapers 4x32AO scope, Weaver rings and intermount with Picatinny rail! Scope and mount are not installed on this gun.   An American classic! The Benjamin 392 .22 cal. rifle is a multi-pump pneumatic. The hardwood Monte Carlo stock is sleek and lightweight. The rifled brass barrel is finished in black and sends pellets out the muzzle up to 685 fps. You can vary the velocity by the number of pumps (up to 8). The 392 has the power and accuracy to take small game and pests, but you'll find yourself picking up this rifle every time you want to plink or shoot spinners.  This gun does not come equipped for a scope from the factory, therefore our specs have it listed as unscopeable. To scope this gun, you have to purchase an aftermarket rail or an intermount. This model comes with both a rail and an intermount.</br></br>  Scope specs:  4x magnification 32mm adjustable objective Mil-dot reticle (range-estimating) 7.5 yds to infinity parallax setting 1/4&quot; click value @ 100 yds 34' field of view @ 100 yds 3.5&quot; eye relief 8mm exit pupil 1&quot; tube True Strength scope Finger-adjustable windage & elevation knobs (5th Gen knob housing) 11.8&quot; long 12.9 oz.

PY-1481	Crosman 760 Pumpmaster, Pink Stock	Crosman	Think pink! Pink guns are the hottest trend. They're the surest way to get girls interested in the shooting sports. Get one for the girl in your family, and you'll be surprised how much she loves shooting! If you're a gun collector, you need to get this one! It's sure to become a collectible!  The 760 Pumpmaster is what all the other multi-pump pneumatics want to be! In production for decades, over 10 million have been sold. It's a repeater that shoots BBs or .177 pellets and does so with power and accuracy.  At less than 3 lbs., it's a great starter air rifle. The stock and forearm are made of a durable synthetic that takes lots of use and still looks good. An economical rifle, the Pumpmaster takes 3 to 10 pumps to send BBs up to 625 fps and pellets up to 600 fps. The checkering on the grip and the indentations on the pump handle make it that much easier to get a grip and stay on target.  Ideal for plinking and target shooting. (Never shoot BBs at hard objects!) It's so light that you can shoot all day! Suitable for younger shooters (with adult supervision) and smaller adults.  Pellets are loaded into a 5-shot clip, while BBs have an 18-shot magazine, which is fed from the 200-shot reservoir. It comes with a fixed front sight, but you can get even more accuracy by mounting a scope or red dot on the 11mm dovetail.

PY-1489-2668	Walther 1250 Dominator	Walther	The Walther 1250 dominator implements the proven engineering of the successful Walther LG300 Dominator in a compressed-air repeating system with 8-shot rotary clip. The bolt-action feeds the pellet directly into the barrel, resulting in precise long-distance shooting with minimal velocity reduction. The gun comes with fiber optic front and rear sights. To get the most accuracy, mount a scope on the 11mm dovetail.  The 300 bar (4350 psi) air reservoir delivers 100 shots at 40 joules (29.5 ft-lbs). There's a built-in gauge on the end of the reservoir. The fiberglass-reinforced synthetic stock has a Monte Carlo buttstock with cheekpieces on both sides. The textured forearm and pistol grip make it easy to have a firm grasp at all times.  If you don't have the equipment to pressurize the gun with 4350 psi air, you can still use it when pressurized at 3000 psi (206 bar). You'll get fewer powerful shots at that pressure, but the gun will still perform as intended and you'll get the same high velocity!

PY-1534-2803	Benjamin Discovery Rifle & Pump	Benjamin	<font color=red>This version of the Discovery includes the gun and the Benjamin 3-stage hand pump with an attached hose that has a female Foster quick-disconnect fitting on the end. Connect the Foster fitting on the end of the hose to the air reservoir on the rifle.   To exhaust air or CO2 from the rifle, you need to purchase the degasser tool.</font>  Get into precharged guns at an unheard-of price and also get the accuracy of an expensive European rifle!  Benjamin has bridged the gap and taken the pain out of PCP guns. Not only is this as low a price as you'll ever find on a PCP/hand pump combo, but it's so easy to pump up that a wispy teenager could do it!  If you prefer to use a scuba tank instead of the hand pump, you'll need a scuba tank adapter with hose and a female quick-disconnect with male threads. The last item already comes with this kit. The adapter fits tanks with a K valve. The air reservoir has a male Foster fitting.   The Discovery has raised the bar for PCP guns because it uses only 2000 psi of air. While the European companies race toward higher and higher air pressures, Benjamin is going the opposite direction and making it easier than ever to use a hand pump. If you want to use a scuba tank or carbon fiber tank, you can do that, too, and get the benefit of many more fills than you would from a gun that operates with 3000 psi. The Discovery gives you a choice! The air reservoir is 135cc.  The gun comes with a hardwood stock (14&quot; length of pull), Williams fiber optic front and rear sights, and a built-in air pressure gauge. Included in the package is a hand pump that's easy to use and very clear on showing you when you've reached maximum operating pressure.  When you open your box, you'll see easy-to-follow and easy-to-understand instructions that'll lead you step-by-step. If you're an experienced PCP user, you'll soon see that the Discovery is the easiest PCP you've ever used. If you're new to PCPs, you'll become a pro in just a few short steps.  If you want to switch to CO2, that's easy to do. A degasser tool lets you quickly and safely exhaust all the high-pressure air (or you can just shoot the air out). Attach the optional CO2 adapter, connect it to a standard paintball CO2 tank and fill 'er up! Now, commence to shootin'!  With high-pressure air, you'll get up to 25 powerful shots before you need to pump up again. On CO2, you'll get a lot more shots per fill.  The Discovery is made in America.		.177 caliber Benjamin Dual Fuel PCP & CO2 rifle.

Not only is this as low a price as you'll ever find on a PCP/hand pump combo, but it's so easy to pump up that a wispy teenager could do it!  If you prefer to use a scuba tank instead of the hand pump, you'll need a scuba tank adapter with hose and a female quick-disconnect with male threads. The last item already comes with this kit. The adapter fits tanks with a K valve. The air reservoir has a male Foster fitting.   The Discovery has raised the bar for PCP guns because it uses only 2000 psi of air. While the European companies race toward higher and higher air pressures, Benjamin is going the opposite direction and making it easier than ever to use a hand pump. If you want to use a scuba tank or carbon fiber tank, you can do that, too, and get the benefit of many more fills than you would from a gun that operates with 3000 psi. The Discovery gives you a choice! The air reservoir is 135cc.  The gun comes with a hardwood stock (14&quot; length of pull), Williams fiber optic front and rear sights, and a built-in air pressure gauge. Included in the package is a hand pump that's easy to use and very clear on showing you when you've reached maximum operating pressure.  When you open your box, you'll see easy-to-follow and easy-to-understand instructions that'll lead you step-by-step. If you're an experienced PCP user, you'll soon see that the Discovery is the easiest PCP you've ever used. If you're new to PCPs, you'll become a pro in just a few short steps.  If you want to switch to CO2, that's easy to do. A degasser tool lets you quickly and safely exhaust all the high-pressure air (or you can just shoot the air out). Attach the optional CO2 adapter, connect it to a standard paintball CO2 tank and fill 'er up! Now, commence to shootin'!  With high-pressure air, you'll get up to 25 powerful shots before you need to pump up again. On CO2, you'll get a lot more shots per fill.  The Discovery is made in America.		.22 caliber Benjamin Dual Fuel PCP & CO2 rifle.

PY-1854-3727	Beeman HW97K Blue	Beeman	The HW97K is related to one of the first - and finest - underlever field target rifles ever made. Coming from the famed plant in Germany, it's proving to be just as accurate. Even if you're not a field target enthusiast, you'll enjoy shooting this rifle! It's great for metallic silhouettes, plinking, shooting spinners and paper targets, and accurate enough to do some serious hunting. If you're hunting game and eliminating pests, .20 or .22 caliber should be your choice.  The quality of the polishing and bluing on the steel action, barrel and underlever exceeds what you'd normally find on comparably priced firearms. The blue laminated stock has a raised RH cheekpiece on the Monte Carlo buttstock. The stock is capped with a soft rubber recoil pad to give you ultimate control.  Includes 1&quot; scope rings, medium profile, vertical scope stop in one ring, 2 screws per base & 4 screws per ring cap.

PY-1896-3882	Beeman RX-2 Air Rifle, No Sights	Beeman	One of the more powerful guns in the Beeman line, the RX-2 isn't a traditional spring gun. Instead of a coiled steel spring, the piston is filled with air. It's like the gas spring that holds up the back door of a minivan or hatchback car. Instead of compressing a steel spring, you're compressing a column of air. You don't have to fill the gas spring because no air ever leaves it.  When you go hunting with a gun that has a gas spring, you never have to worry about the spring taking a &quot;set.&quot; When you cock a gun with a metal spring, you're supposed to shoot it right away. If you leave it cocked too long (and do that too many times), the spring loses strength, remains more compressed when it's uncocked and delivers lower power. That won't happen with a gas spring!  In any caliber, the RX-2 makes a great hunting rifle. In .22 cal., it delivers over 20 foot-pounds.  Includes 1&quot; scope rings, medium profile, vertical scope stop in one ring, 2 screws per base & 4 screws per ring cap.  Here are the benefits of a gas-piston over a spring-piston powerplant:  Smoother cocking Smoother shooting No spring torque No spring fatigue, even if you leave it cocked for hours Functions perfectly in cold weather Lasts longer than a metal spring 		New!

PY-2215	Crosman 760X Pumpmaster Combo	Crosman	The Crosman 760 Pumpmaster is what all the other multi-pump pneumatics want to be! In production for decades, over 10 million have been sold. It shoots BBs or .177 pellets and does so with power and accuracy.   At less than 3 lbs., it's a great starter air rifle. The stock and forearm are made of a durable synthetic that takes lots of use and still looks good. An economical rifle, the Pumpmaster takes 3 to 10 pumps to send BBs up to 625 fps and pellets up to 600 fps. The checkering on the grip and the indentations on the pump handle make it that much easier to get a grip and stay on target.  Ideal for plinking and target shooting. (Never shoot BBs at water or hard objects!) It's so light that you can shoot all day! Suitable for younger shooters (with adult supervision) and smaller adults.  Pellets are loaded into a 5-shot clip, while BBs have an 18-shot magazine, which is fed from the 200-shot reservoir. Includes a 4x15 scope, fixed front sight and adjustable metal rear sight.		Versatile multi-pump pneumatic shoots BBs or pellets. Includes 4x15 scope.	http://www.pyramydair.com/images/Crosman-Pumpmaster-760X-Scope_CR760X_lg.jpg	2.86	0.177	625.00			60.00	44.99		100	CR760X	40.55	http://www.pyramydair.com/images/Crosman-Pumpmaster-760X-Scope_CR760X_sm.jpg	AIR RIFLES	028478131170	false

PY-2980-5777	Webley Rebel Air Rifle	Webley & Scott Ltd.	 Webley Rebel air rifle Mutli-pump pneumatic (up to 8 pumps) Single-shot Bolt-action (push bolt) cocking Manual safety Synthetic Monte Carlo stock Stippled pistol grip and forearm (pump handle) Raised right-hand cheekpiece Fixed fiber optic front sight Fully adjustable fiber optic rear sight mounts on scope dovetail grooves 11mm dovetail grooves   The manufacturer's spec sheet for this air rifle incorrectly states it has a ramp front sight with a post and a rear peep sight. Both front and rear sights are fiber optics.  It's a good idea to put 1 or 2 pumps into a multi-pump before you put it away for the day.

The easy-to-use power-adjust wheel takes your rifle from 400 fps to 1100 fps. You decide how much power you want and when you want it. If you're shooting field target...dial it down.

Made of space-age polymers and aircraft-grade aluminum, the AirForce Talon air rifle is lightweight and equipped with a durable finish.  The removable 490cc air tank (DOT-certified) can be filled with a hand pump, scuba tank or electric compressor to 3000 psi (206 bar) for lots of shots without a refill. The tank does double-duty as the butt of the AirForce air rifle, contributing to its light weight and convenience. The tank has a pressure-release valve for additional safety.  Thanks to the new Spin-Loc tank and collar, you don't have to remove the gun's air reservoir to fill it. Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get both! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.   <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air.

PY-379-1036	AirForce Condor PCP Air Rifle, Spin-Loc Tank	AirForce	The AirForce Condor delivers from 600 fps to a rip-snorting 1450 fps (in .177), and it's recoilless! Accurate (1&quot; at 50 yards) and powerful, this PCP offers extreme flexibility. It has a 24&quot; Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist). You can also buy 12&quot; and 18&quot; barrels. Change-outs are easy and don't require any special tools. Built in the USA.  <font color=red>NOTE:</font> The .20 cal. pellets are slightly longer than the .22 cal. pellets of the same weight. Therefore, they drag in the barrel a little more and produce lower velocities. The quoted figures (showing the .20 cal. gun shooting slower than the .22 cal. gun) are actual test figures and are correct.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air. The type of adapter depends on how you plan to fill your gun. A scuba tank will require a different adapter than a hand pump or carbon fiber tank. If you use a hand pump, the type of adapter you need depends on the brand of hand pump you use.</font>  Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills. Includes new Spin-Loc tank, which includes an air pressure gauge (manometer).  There are lots of ways to configure this gun, including rail-mounted accessories (coin-slot screws for each changeout). You can choose the scope, laser, flashlight, night vision equipment, extra tanks, quick-detach fiber-optic sights and attachments for the type of refilling unit you plan to use. If you replace the barrel with a longer one, the gun will not be silenced.

PY-2243-4485	AirForce Talon SS PCP Air Rifle, Spin-Loc, Blue	AirForce	For those of you who want the look, feel and power of a black rifle...but with color! Choose the Talon SS with a blue anodized frame.  <strong><font color=red>Equipped with the new Sound-Loc suppressor!</font></strong>  Power! Up to 1000 fps (in .177). Accuracy! 1&quot; at 50 yards. NO recoil! Built in the USA, the Talon SS pre-charged pneumatic air rifle is for serious shooting. Field target, hunting, punching paper targets, shooting spinners and plinking are all perfect for the Talon SS...because it does everything so well! The easy-to-use power-adjust wheel takes your rifle from 400 fps to 1000 fps. You decide how much power you want and when you want it. If you're shooting field target...dial it down. Hunting...dial it up.  From its Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist) to its removable air tank, the Talon SS is the standard for state-of-the-art manufacturing of pre-charged pneumatics. Made of space-age polymers and aircraft-grade aluminum, the AirForce Talon SS is lightweight and equipped with a durable finish.   The removable 490cc air tank (DOT-certified) can be filled with a hand pump, scuba tank or electric compressor to 3000 psi (206 bar) for lots of shots without a refill. The tank does double-duty as the butt of the gun, contributing to its light weight and convenience. The tank has a pressure-release valve for additional safety.  Thanks to the new Spin-Loc tank and collar, you don't have to remove the gun's air reservoir to fill it. Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get all of them! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.  The Talon SS is the same basic rifle as the Talon, but an integral suppressor and a 12&quot; barrel are standard. The shorter barrel makes it slightly lighter than the Talon, and the integral suppressor seriously reduces the report.  There are lots of ways to configure this gun, including rail-mounted accessories (coin-slot screws for each changeout). You can choose the laser, flashlight, night vision equipment, extra tanks, quick-detach fiber-optic sights and attachments for the type of refilling unit you plan to use. If you replace the barrel with a longer one, the gun will not be silenced.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air. The type of adapter depends on how you plan to fill your gun. A scuba tank will require a different adapter than a hand pump or carbon fiber tank.

Choose the Talon SS with a red anodized frame.</Strong>  <strong><font color=red>Equipped with the new Sound-Loc suppressor!</font></strong>  Power! Up to 1000 fps (in .177). Accuracy! 1&quot; at 50 yards. <strong>NO recoil!</strong> Built in the USA, the Talon SS pre-charged pneumatic air rifle is for serious shooting. Field target, hunting, punching paper targets, shooting spinners and plinking are all perfect for the Talon SS...because it does everything so well! The easy-to-use power-adjust wheel takes your rifle from 400 fps to 1000 fps. You decide how much power you want and when you want it. If you're shooting field target...dial it down. Hunting...dial it up.  From its Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist) to its removable air tank, the Talon SS is the standard for state-of-the-art manufacturing of pre-charged pneumatics. Made of space-age polymers and aircraft-grade aluminum, the AirForce Talon SS is lightweight and equipped with a durable finish.   The removable 490cc air tank (DOT-certified) can be filled with a hand pump, scuba tank or electric compressor to 3000 psi (206 bar) for lots of shots without a refill. The tank does double-duty as the butt of the gun, contributing to its light weight and convenience. The tank has a pressure-release valve for additional safety.  Thanks to the new Spin-Loc tank and collar, you don't have to remove the gun's air reservoir to fill it. Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get all of them! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.  The Talon SS is the same basic rifle as the Talon, but an integral suppressor and a 12&quot; barrel are standard. The shorter barrel makes it slightly lighter than the Talon, and the integral suppressor seriously reduces the report.  There are lots of ways to configure this gun, including rail-mounted accessories (coin-slot screws for each changeout). You can choose the laser, flashlight, night vision equipment, extra tanks, quick-detach fiber-optic sights and attachments for the type of refilling unit you plan to use. If you replace the barrel with a longer one, the gun will not be silenced.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air. The type of adapter depends on how you plan to fill your gun. A scuba tank will require a different adapter than a hand pump or carbon fiber tank. If you use a hand pump, the type of adapter you need depends on the brand of hand pump you use.</font>		AirForce Talon SS PCP Air Rifle, Spin-Loc Tank, .25 Cal, Red	http://www.pyramydair.com/images/AF-TalonSS-W-Spin-Loc-Tank-RED_AFU20232R.jpg	4.31	0.25	665.00	submodel	PY-2244	620.00	589.00	2014-05-08	0	AFU202325R	474.30	http://www.pyramydair.com/images/AF-TalonSS-W-Spin-Loc-Tank-RED_AFU20232R_sm.jpg	AIR RIFLES		false

Crank the power wheel up to max velocity and hunt without interruption, getting up to 35 shots.

The AirForce Condor delivers from 600 fps to a rip-snorting 1300 fps (in .177), and it's recoilless! Accurate (1&quot; at 50 yards) and powerful, this PCP offers extreme flexibility. It has an 18&quot; Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist). You can also buy 12&quot; and 24&quot; barrels. Change-outs are easy and don't require any special tools, but the gun will be unsilenced. Built in the USA.  <font color=red>NOTE:</font> The .20 cal. pellets are slightly longer than the .22 cal. pellets of the same weight. Therefore, they drag in the barrel a little more and produce lower velocities. The quoted figures (showing the .20 cal. gun shooting slower than the .22 cal. gun) are actual test figures and are correct.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air. The type of adapter depends on how you plan to fill your gun. A scuba tank will require a different adapter than a hand pump or carbon fiber tank. If you use a hand pump, the type of adapter you need depends on the brand of hand pump you use.</font>  There are lots of ways to configure this gun, including rail-mounted accessories (coin-slot screws for each changeout). You can choose the scope, laser, flashlight, night vision equipment, extra tanks, quick-detach fiber-optic sights and attachments for the type of refilling unit you plan to use. If you replace the barrel with a longer one, the gun will not be silenced.  Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.

PY-3071	AirForce Talon SS, Red Precharged Pneumatic Rifle	AirForce	For those of you who want the look, feel and power of a black rifle...but with color! Choose the Talon SS with a red anodized frame.  Power! Up to 1000 fps (in .177). Accuracy! 1&quot; at 50 yards. NO recoil! Built in the USA, the Talon SS pre-charged pneumatic air rifle is for serious shooting. Field target, hunting, punching paper targets, shooting spinners and plinking are all perfect for the Talon SS...because it does everything so well! The easy-to-use power-adjust wheel takes your rifle from 400 fps to 1000 fps. You decide how much power you want and when you want it. If you're shooting field target...dial it down. Hunting...dial it up.  From its Lothar Walther barrel (1:16 twist) to its removable air tank, the Talon SS is the standard for state-of-the-art manufacturing of pre-charged pneumatics. Made of space-age polymers and aircraft-grade aluminum, the AirForce Talon SS is lightweight and equipped with a durable finish.   The removable 490cc air tank (DOT-certified) can be filled with a hand pump, scuba tank or electric compressor to 3000 psi (206 bar) for lots of shots without a refill. The tank does double-duty as the butt of the gun, contributing to its light weight and convenience. The tank has a pressure-release valve for additional safety.  Not sure which caliber to get? Get all of them! Extra barrels are available, and change-outs are quick and easy and don't require any special tools.  The Talon SS is the same basic rifle as the Talon, but an integral suppressor and a 12&quot; barrel are standard. The shorter barrel makes it slightly lighter than the Talon, and the integral suppressor seriously reduces the report.  There are lots of ways to configure this gun, including rail-mounted accessories (coin-slot screws for each changeout). You can choose the laser, flashlight, night vision equipment, extra tanks, quick-detach fiber-optic sights and attachments for the type of refilling unit you plan to use. If you replace the barrel with a longer one, the gun will not be silenced.  <font color=red>You'll need an adapter to fill the reservoir with air. The type of adapter depends on how you plan to fill your gun. A scuba tank will require a different adapter than a hand pump or carbon fiber tank.

PY-555-1144	Beeman P1 Air Pistol	Beeman	Looks like a .45 1911 firearm...and just as accurate! Made in Germany by the legendary Weihrauch company, the Beeman P1 is considered by many to be the Holy Grail of air pistols. This is an heirloom airgun that you'll pass along to your grandchildren and beyond.  The gun's heft and balance convey quality and substance. It fills your hand without feeling bulky or oversized. The unusual overlever cocking mechanism compresses the powerful mainspring, and the hammer is actually the catch for it. Highly adjustable two-stage trigger, which has a serrated surface for more control, will help you extract maximum accuracy from the P1. In fact, the adjustable trigger is so crisp, you'll wish it was on your firearms.  The dovetail grooves are extra wide, and our accessory list has several 11mm to 14mm mounts that are known to fit.  Unlike many modern air pistols, the P1 isn't made of molded synthetics. It's a solid metal gun with finely checkered walnut grips. And, it's ambidextrous. The 11mm dovetails make it easy to mount a pistol scope or a red dot sight.  The P1 has two power levels. The different power levels are created by cocking the gun to different lock points. See the detail shots to see how to cock the gun for high power and low power.  The distance you shoot, the weight of the pellet and the type of target will let you determine which power level is best. The P1 is an excellent indoor trainer for those who shoot the M1911A1.

PY-556	Beeman P3	Beeman	Solid construction, accurate, light trigger-pull, easy to cock, fun to shoot! That's just about everything you could ever want in an air pistol. The Beeman P3 is a single-stroke pneumatic, which means it requires just one cocking stroke of the overlever. Because it doesn't have a mainspring, the P3 can also be dry-fired.

Manufactured by the legendary Weihrauch factory in Germany, this air pistol has a rifled steel barrel. In fact, all critical mechanisms are made of ordnance steel, while the exterior shell is made of tough, durable polymers.Whether you shoot right-handed, left-handed, single-handed or two-handed, the Beeman P3 can accommodate you!

Spend less time (and money) on small CO2 cartridges and more time shooting. If you want to convert back to 12-gram CO2 cartridges, you can easily do that! <font color=red>As shown in the picture, the CO2 gas flows from the tank into an adapter housed in the grip. That adapter is the same size and shape as a standard 12-gram CO2 cartridge.</font>  There are three switches to operate the unique select-fire mechanism. The first one turns on the gun. The second one selects the firing mode: semi-auto (one shot with each pull of the trigger), three-round burst (full-auto) or six-round burst (full-auto). The third switch controls the burst rate: 300 rounds per minute, 450 rounds per minute or 600 rounds per minute.

Airgun writer Tom Gaylord tested this gun for the Pyramyd Air blog and got 755 fps when using extremly lightweight alloy (lead-free, 4.0 grains) pellets. If you use lightweight lead pellets (7.0 grains), your velocity will be around 560 to 580 fps. He found that Gamo Match pellets (7.56 grains) delivered the best accuracy when shooting the pistol from a rested position.		LP8 Magnum pistol.

PY-2400	AirForce TalonP PCP Air Pistol, Spin-Loc Tank	AirForce	 Airforce Airguns TalonP air pistol Precharged pneumatic Single-shot Bolt-action 11mm dovetail (no open sights) 12&quot; barrel 2-stage trigger (adj. for position only) Textured grip 213cc tank 3000 psi max fill pressure Adjustable power wheel Up to 30 shots on low power & up to 12 shots on high power The TalonP is NOT silenced & does not have baffles   Thanks to the new Spin-Loc tank and collar, you don't have to remove the gun's air reservoir to fill it. Of course, if you want to, you can remove it easily and attach another one. Carrying an extra filled tank when shooting in the field is a lot easier than carrying a scuba or carbon fiber tank for refills.  Most dot sights have Weaver mounts. If you choose one of them, remember to pick up AirForce's 11mm-to-Weaver adapter listed in the accessories link.  The AirForce TalonP PCP pistol is heavier than most air pistols and cannot be comfortably held the way most pistols are held and still result in reliable, repeatable accuracy. A comfortable hold is with one hand on the pistol grip and the other holding the top of the scope. If you assume a sitting position, you can hold the grip with one hand and rest the gun's forearm on your off hand's forearm. These two positions will draw the pistol much closer to your eye, and you can mount a rifle scope on the TalonP air pistol. A pistol scope could also be mounted, but there are more choices among rifle scopes.

To wind the magazine turn the wheel on the bottom of the magazine. As you wind the magazine it will make a ticking noise. You will notice that BBs will feed up into the top of the magazine and are visible at the top. Keep winding until the ticking changes to a louder clicking noise which means the magazine is fully wound. Sometimes it is better to wind the magazine after you put it in the gun. If the BB release is bumped while you are putting the magazine into the gun the BBs can spray out and you will have to start all over again.			http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/LEMAG-M87L.jpg	0.95					10.50	7.49		100	LEMAG-M87L	6.43	http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/LEMAG-M87Ls.jpg	AIRSOFT MAGAZINES/CLIPS	4712274520714	false

It's a carbon fiber tank, which is also called an scba tank, and has a high-pressure scba valve...like the one firefighters use on their scba tanks. Many dive shops do not have the ability to fill these tanks. In some towns, the fire department has a compressor that can fill a high-pressure carbon fiber tank, as firefighters use smaller scba tanks for breathing equipment during rescues.  You might want to approach your local fire department and ask if they would be willing to fill your high-pressure carbon fiber/scba tank from their compressor. Another alternative is to contact a local paintball store, as paintballers use carbon fiber tanks to fill their markers.  If the only alternative you have is to fill your high-pressure carbon fiber scba tank at a dive shop, a 1/8&quot; BSPP male to DIN female adapter (our part # AA-Z2128-300) can temporarily replace the hose on the valve adapter so the dive shop can fill your tank.			http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/Carbon-Fiber-Tank-4500-psi-88-cu-ft_AV-4500HPT.jpg	5.31					749.95	699.99	2014-06-15	0	AV-4500HPT	573.75	http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/Carbon-Fiber-Tank-4500-psi-88-cu-ft_AV-4500HPT_sm.jpg	PRECHARGED GUN ACCESSORIES		false

Mil-Dot Reticle, 1/4 MOA, 30mm tube, Weaver Rings	UTG	 Rifle scope 1.5-6x magnification 44mm objective lens  30mm tube 1/4 MOA (1/4&quot; click value @ 100 yds) Red/green* illuminated mil-dot reticle (36-color illumination enhancing) 100 yds parallax setting 57.6 ft to 17.3 ft field of view 3.9&quot; to 3&quot; eye relief 17.2mm to 7.3mm exit pupil    22.8 oz. 12.99&quot; long Includes 1 CR2032 battery, flip-open lens caps, hex screw & Max Strength Twist Lock Weaver rings   Other features:  True Strength scope Emerald-coated optics (95% light transmission) Nitrogen-filled Shockproof  Fogproof  Rainproof Built-in color/brightness memory system EZ-TAP Illumination enhancing (IE) technology w/RGB (red-green-black*) in dual-color mode and 36 colors in multi-color mode Zero lock/reset target turrets Integral sunshade (angled objective) Black matte finish   *If you don't use the illumination, the reticle will be black.  This is a premium scope that will serve you well in any lighting condition...from dawn to dusk. The red/green mil-dot reticle will work for most bright-light conditions, but the 36-color option will give you the edge in dimmer light. The biggest advantage to the additional color is when you're shooting something that's the same color as your reticle! If you're hunting and your quarry is hidden among greenery, use a contrasting color to see all the points on your lit mil-dot reticle.  The 30mm tube lets in a lot of light, and the emerald-coated lenses offer the most amount of light compared to other types of coatings. The True Strength platform can take the harsh 2-way recoil of magnum spring-piston air rifles, but this scope is also suitable for firearms and airsoft guns.			http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/UTG-30mm-1-5-6x44-IE-Mil-dot-scope_SCP3-U156IEW_01.jpg	1.06					139.00	119.95		100	SCP3-U156IEW	95.81	http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/UTG-30mm-1-5-6x44-IE-Mil-dot-scope_SCP3-U156IEW_sm01.jpg	SCOPES	4712274528826	false

This UTG scope has an etched-glass reticle, which is superior to a wire reticle because it's etched by a laser and is much more precise. That lets you get even more accuracy from your gun. Another way that etched-glass reticles are superior to wire reticles is when they're illuminated. The etched ones show the illumination only on the reticle. It looks like the reticle is floating. Wire reticles often have a reflection of the illumination in the objective lens, which can be distracting when shooting.  This is a premium scope, and you'll be hard-pressed to find another one with all these features for anywhere close to this price. Put this item on your airgun, airsoft gun or firearm and get ready to see clearly. The emerald-coated optics offer 95% light transmission, which is enhanced by the big 30mm tube. This is perfect when you need to zero-in on distant targets. The mil-dot reticle is etched into the objective lens, and can be just about any color you need. This is especially useful if you're shooting in low-light conditions or if your target is the same color as the traditional black reticle.			http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/UTG-30mm-1-5-6x44-IE-Mil-Dot-WR_SCP3-UG156iew_01.jpg	1.06					169.97	139.97		100	SCP3-UG156IEW	108.94	http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/UTG-30mm-1-5-6x44-IE-Mil-Dot-WR_SCP3-UG156iew_sm01.jpg	SCOPES	4712274528796	false

Modestly priced, this Leapers UTG rifle scope has many features you'd normally find in more expensive models. For starters, many airgun scopes don't have the flexible parallax adjustment this one does. Airgunners who like to shoot annoying flying insects or dispatch squirrels raiding the bird feeder should get this scope. It'll help you acquire your targets quickly because parallax can be adjusted down to 5 yards. Many scopes weight over 24 oz., this one is just barely over 18 oz. Plus, it's not huge and should fit most air rifles. If you like to shoot firearms, mount this scope on any of your rimfire guns (you'll have to get Weaver rings to mount it on centerfire rifles).			http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/UTG-1-inch-3-9x32-TF2-airgun-scope_SCP-U392AODT2_01.jpg	0.93					99.99	79.99	2014-05-30	0	SCP-U392AODT2	65.00	http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/UTG-1-inch-3-9x32-TF2-airgun-scope_SCP-U392AODT2_sm01.jpg	SCOPES	4712274529663	false

The etched ones show the illumination only on the reticle. It looks like the reticle is floating. Wire reticles often have a reflection of the illumination in the objective lens, which can be distracting when shooting.			http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/UTG-30mm-6-24x56-AO-etched-mil-dot_SCP3UG6245AOIEW.jpg	1.21					259.99	229.99		100	SCP3UG6245AOIEW	193.79	http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/UTG-30mm-6-24x56-AO-etched-mil-dot_SCP3UG6245AOIEW_sm.jpg	SCOPES	4712274522220	false

PY-A-1972	IZH Drozd BB Gun Fake Suppressor	IZH-Baikal	Includes suppressor, adapter and knurled thread protector.  Want the suppressor look and feel for your Drozd BB gun without the expense, hassle and government oversight? Our .22LR fake suppressor is as close to a real suppressor as you can get without paying the tax stamp.  It's CNC-machined from a solid aluminum rod, given a durable liquid ceramic finish and professionally laser-engraved. Everything is identical to the real ATF-registered suppressors!   Since its a fake suppressor, the gun's report (loudness) is NOT reduced. Many shooters prefer the weight and balance improvement with the added suppressor. In fact, it'll work on any airgun that has a 1/2&quot;x28 TPI threaded barrel.  To ensure exact thread alignment, the threaded adapters are CNC-machined to precision tolerances from a solid steel rod in one lathe operation. They are hot-salt blued to match the gun. The included steel thread protector covers the threads on your barrel when no accessory is mounted. Easy installation in place of the existing barrel nut. No tools or modifications are required.			http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/Drozd_Suppressor_1972.jpg	0.45					59.99	50.50		100	IZH-SUPFS22	38.21	http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/Drozd_Suppressor_1972_sm.jpg	SHOOTING NEEDS AND ACCESSORIES		false

PY-A-1018	Air Venturi A.G.E. Quiet Pellet Trap, Incl. Ballistic Putty	Air Venturi	Tired of having pellets and BBs scatter all over the house? The Quiet Pellet Trap ends that problem forever, because it's loaded with 10 lbs. of ballistic putty that captures and holds your ammo. It's great for outdoor use, too! The trap is suited to guns that produce less than 18 foot-pounds of energy at 10 meters.  If you notice your ammo popping out of the trap, then it's time to remove the pellets and BBs stuck in the putty. But, that won't happen until you've shot a LOT of rounds.  The frame of the trap is made of walnut-stained pine. It's 13.5&quot;Hx12.5&quot;W. There's a groove that accepts a target, such as the <a href=&quot;http://www.pyramydair.com/s/a/National_Target_Air_Rifle_Target_12_Bullseye_100_ct/3539&quot;>NRA official 10-meter 12-bull air rifle target</a>.

PY-A-4441	Ecotarget Ice Target Mold, 2 Target Sizes	Ecotarget	 Ice target mold 2 target sizes (5 are 3&quot;Wx4&quot;H and 4 are 1.5&quot;Wx2&quot;H) Fill mold with water, freeze, pop out targets and shoot Shot targets produce an exciting shattering effect Environmentally friendly No cleanup or dangerous residue that could injure people, pets or wildlife Cheap to make User-adjustable for thickness and color Use with pellet guns or firearms (never shoot steel BBs at these...they'll ricochet) Made in USA   If you can turn on a faucet, you can make your own reactive targets. No technology, no special skills, no mess. ALWAYS wear safety glasses and remove all pets from the area as the targets will shatter in all directions.  DIRECTIONS:  Place empty mold in freezer Fill cavities with water (soda bottle works well) For 1/4&quot; thickness, fill to witness mark found at apex of each target For 3/8&quot; thickness, fill to the top of the cavity To remove targets from mold, remove mold from freezer & let rest on counter for 3-4 minutes at room temp To unmold, hold mold upside down over a towel and gently twist at opposite corners Store unmolded targets in freezer til you're ready to shoot   If you want to enhance your targets, add some food coloring. That also makes them easier to see. Get more than one mold and stack filled molds in your freezer. Fill and leave them in the freezer until you're ready to use them. That way, you'll always have some available whenever the mood strikes you to shoot.  In warmer weather, your ice targets may melt faster than you like. Inhibit fast melting by making pykrete, which is a mixture of 14% sawdust and 86% water (by weight...frozen). They'll last longer than dry ice but won't shatter as well as plain ice targets.			http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/EcoTarget-ICE-Target-mold_ECO-H2001.jpg	1.36					14.95	9.99		100	ECO-H2001	7.04	http://www.airventuri.com/images/acc/EcoTarget-ICE-Target-mold_ECO-H2001_sm.jpg	TARGETS, PELLET AND BB TRAPS, RANGES	713757729000	false

PY-P-916	Beeman Devastator, .177 Cal, 7.1 Grains, Pointed, 300ct	Beeman	 .177 caliber 7.1 grains Pointed 300 pellets </br>  This is not an ordinary pointed pellet! The Beeman Devastator pellet's patented design has a hollow head and a projecting point coming out of it. Around the edge of the hollowpoint are nicks.  On impact, these nicks create an extreme mushrooming effect that forces the point to project even further. Unique but also amazingly effective! Having the qualities of both a hollowpoint and a pointed pellet, this lead projectile will prove highly effective for hunters and pest eliminators. The mushrooming hollowpoint is the first hit, but the extra penetration of the point is like a second hit on the same quarry.  The world's only partitioned hollowpoint pellet!			http://www.airventuri.com/images/Beeman-Devastator-177cal_BN-52177_pellet_lg.jpg	0.32	0.177				12.95	11.95		100	BN-52177	6.43	http://www.airventuri.com/images/Beeman-Devastator-177cal_BN-52177_sm.jpg	AMMO	850488002825	false
