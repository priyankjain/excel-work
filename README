I have an excel spreadsheet that has my products on it. I get an update every month. I need a macro that will compare the item numbers and update the weight and cost columns. It would be also nice to know which items (new) are not currently on my existing sheet. The spreadsheet Air April 16 is my finished sheet. The dealer.txt file is the file I get the new info from. Product_model is from the XLS and SKU is from the TXT file. Wnet is the cost column that needs to change.
